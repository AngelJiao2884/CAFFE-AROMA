## Layout & rules

* **Headlines:** ≤ 6 words; buttons use CTA “Order Ahead” where relevant
* **Contrast:** enforce ≥ 4.5:1 by adjusting token pairings only (never change token hex)
* **Images:** use `next/image` placeholders, sizes set to avoid CLS; lazy-load non-critical sections

## Output

1. **Plan** (bullets)
2. **Unified diff** for all files: project init, `tailwind.config`, global CSS, components, page assembly
3. **QA checklist** you verified (a11y landmarks/headings/labels, contrast report, Lighthouse mobile estimate, CLS notes, keyboard tab order)
